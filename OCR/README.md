Image to speech consists of two main modules:\

Optical Character Recognition(OCR):
	It is the process of recognition and automatic conversion of existing characters in the written-support image into the text format
	The process of optical character recognition can be summarized as a process that follows a set of steps: 
	 Optical image acquisition 
	 Location and segmentation 
	 Preprocessing 
	 Feature extraction 
	 Classification 
	 Postprocessing\
	 
Text to Speech(TTS) synthesis:
	--Voice synthesis, defined as TTS (acronym for Text-To-Speech), is a computer system that should be able to read aloud any text, regardless of its origin.
	--TTS synthesis makes use of techniques of Natural Language Processing.
	There are several techniques to create a synthesized voice : 
	• Concatenation synthesis 
	• Parametric synthesis 
	• Formant synthesis
